# classical-cv
This repository is meant for people who are trying to get into Classical computer vision, it will contain code implementation to some of the most famous classical computer vision algorithms and techniques, research papers and videos, all in one repository to learn and get familiarised with classical computer vision.

The end goal/future idea is to make a UI where one can upload images and click on the algorithm he/she wants to try on the images he/she chooses and can view the result!
